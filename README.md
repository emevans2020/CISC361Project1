# CISC361Project1
This is the first project for CISC361 operating systems that takes in an mp3s title, artist name, release date, and duration of the song.
You can add and remove songs based on the artist and also delete the entire mp3 list. 
The list of mp3s can be printed from first to last or last to first.

I used a doubly linked list and also used an MP3 struct (or node).
